# Project Instructions

This project gives the user the possibility to get infos about an upcoming trip by entering a city and departure time and getting back the weather for the trip and a nice image.

Therefore three APIs are used:
- Getting coords from City-Names: [geonames API](https://www.geonames.org/)
- Getting weather information: DarkSky [DarkSky API](https://darksky.net/)
- Getting images for the city: Pixybay [Pixabay API](https://pixabay.com/)

## Getting started

- You can make a productive build using `npm run build-prod`.
- Then you can start the backend server with `node src/server/server.js`.
- Or as shortcut run `npm run start`.

Or you can start a dev server with `npm run build-dev`. 

## Additionla infos
I chose as additional task to display icons for the weather forecast.
